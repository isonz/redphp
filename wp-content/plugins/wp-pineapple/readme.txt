WP Pineapple adds a fruity looking anti-spam, anti-bot "are you human" test to your comment form.

== Description ==

Hate spam comments on your blog?

Find a traditional captcha challenge annoying and cumbersome?

If you are nodding your head and screaming "YES" then this fruity Wordpress plugin is for you!

Normal captchas are a pain to fill in, and sometimes are so unclear they are impossible to pass leaving your visitors stumped.

WP Pineapple adds a simple "one click" solution, prompting the user to click a fruit, and we all know spam-bots hate fruit!

Easy to install and easy for your vistors to use. A perfect plugin for combatting spam.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-pineapple` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress and hey presto, you're comment forms and equipped with anti-spam fruity goodness.

== Screenshots ==

1. A fruity selection will appear on your comment forms.
